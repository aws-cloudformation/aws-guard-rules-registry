# Guard Registry Rule Set Releases

Guard Rule Sets are versioned and tracked in the Guard Rule Registry managed rules release process.The process entails our open-source community creating Pull-Request from forking and submitting the Pull-Request targeting the main branch.  Upon Pull-Request approval, all Guard Registry Rule Sets located in the [./mapping](../mappings/) directory are tested,  built and bundled into a single artifact zip file suffixed with timestamp. The artifacts are available for download and beta testing. A formal publishing process will happen when the Guard Rules Registry admin team create a version tag, release notes, and merge the main branch into the publish branch. The publishing branch entails a pipeline that builds the Guard Registry Rule Set based on the git tag version and updates the AWS ECR docker image with the latest tag.
